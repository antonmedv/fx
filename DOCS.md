## Getting started

`fx` can work in two modes: cli and interactive. To start interactive mode pipe any JSON into `fx`:

```bash
$ curl ... | fx
```

Or you can pass a filename as the first parameter:

```bash
$ fx my.json
```

If any argument was passed, `fx` will apply it and prints to stdout.

## Usage

### Anonymous function

Use an anonymous function as reducer which gets JSON and processes it:
```bash
$ echo '{"foo": [{"bar": "value"}]}' | fx 'x => x.foo[0].bar'
value
```

### Binding

If you don't pass anonymous function `param => ...`, code will be automatically transformed into anonymous function.
And you can get access to JSON by `this` keyword:
```bash
$ echo '{"foo": [{"bar": "value"}]}' | fx 'this.foo[0].bar'
value
```

### Dot

It is possible to omit `this` keyword:
```bash
$ echo '{"foo": [{"bar": "value"}]}' | fx .foo[0].bar
value
```

If a single dot is passed, the input JSON will be formatted but otherwise unaltered:
```bash
$ echo '{"foo": "bar"}' | fx .
{
  "foo": "bar"
}
```

### Map

One of the frequent operations is mapping some function on an array. For example, to extract some values.

```
[
  {
    "author": {
      "name": "antonmedv"
    }
  },
  {...},
  ...
]
```

And we want to collect names of each object in the array. We can do this by mapping anonymous function:

```bash
$ cat ... | fx '.map(x => x.author.name)'
```

Or we can do the same by using jq-like syntax:

```bash
$ cat ... | fx .[].author.name
[
  "antonmedv",
  ...
]
```

> Note what `[]` can be applied to map object values.
> ```bash
> $ echo '{"foo": 1, "bar": 2}' | fx .[]
> [1, 2]
> ```


### Chaining

You can pass any number of anonymous functions for reducing JSON:
```bash
$ echo '{"foo": [{"bar": "value"}]}' | fx 'x => x.foo' 'this[0]' 'this.bar'
value
```

### Updating

You can update existing JSON using the spread operator:

```bash
$ echo '{"count": 0}' | fx '{...this, count: 1}'
{
  "count": 1
}
```

### Edit-in-place

`fx` provides a function `save` which will save everything in place and return saved object.
This function can be only used with filename as first argument to `fx` command. 

Usage:

```bash
fx data.json '{...this, count: this.count+1}' save .count
```

### Using packages

Use any npm package by installing it globally:
```bash
$ npm install -g lodash
$ cat package.json | fx 'require("lodash").keys(this.dependencies)'
```

## Using .fxrc

Create _.fxrc_ file in `$HOME` directory, and require any packages or define global functions.

For example, access all lodash methods without `_` prefix. Put in your `.fxrc` file:

```js
Object.assign(global, require('lodash/fp'))
```

And now you will be able to call all lodash methods. For example, see who's been committing to react recently:

```bash
curl 'https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/commits?per_page=100' \
| fx 'groupBy("commit.author.name")' 'mapValues(size)' toPairs 'sortBy(1)' reverse 'take(10)' fromPairs
```

> To be able require global modules make sure you have correct `NODE_PATH` env variable.
> ```bash
> export NODE_PATH=`npm root -g`
> ```

### Query language

If you want to use query language, for example [jsonata](http://jsonata.org/) you can use helper function like this:

```js
global.jsonata = expr => require('jsonata')(expr).evaluate
``` 

And use it like this:

```bash
curl ... | fx 'jsonata("$sum(Order.Product.(Price * Quantity))")'
```

Instead you can create next alias in _.bashrc_ file:

```bash
alias jsonata='FX_APPLY=jsonata fx'
```

And now all code arguments to `jsonata` will be passed through `jsonata` helper. And now you can use it like this:

```bash
curl ... | jsonata '$sum(Order.Product.(Price * Quantity))'
```

## Formatting

If you need output other than JSON (for example arguments for xargs), do not return anything from the reducer.
`undefined` value is printed into stderr by default.
```bash
echo '[]' | fx 'void 0'
undefined
```

```bash
echo '[1,2,3]' | fx 'this.forEach(x => console.log(+x))' 2>/dev/null | xargs echo
1 2 3
```

## Other examples

Convert object to array:
```bash
$ cat package.json | fx 'Object.keys(this.dependencies)'
```

Or by two functions:
```bash
$ cat package.json | fx .dependencies Object.keys
```

By the way, fx has shortcut for `Object.keys`. Previous example can be rewritten as:

```bash
$ cat package.json | fx .dependencies ?
``` 

## Streaming mode

`fx` supports line-delimited JSON and concatenated JSON streaming.

```bash
$ kubectl logs ... | fx .message
```

> Note what is object lacks `message` field, _undefined_ will be printed to stderr.
> This is useful to see if you are skipping some objects. But if you want to hide them,
> redirect stderr to `/dev/null`.

### Filtering

Sometimes it is necessary to omit some messages in JSON stream, or select only specified log messages.
For this purpose, `fx` has special helpers `select`/`filter`, pass function into it to select/filter JSON messages.

```bash
$ kubectl logs ... | fx 'select(x => x.status == 500)' .message
```

```bash
$ kubectl logs ... | fx 'filter(x => x.status < 499)' .message
```

> If `filter`/`select` overridden in _.fxrc_ you still able to access them with prefix:
> `std.select(cb)` or `std.filter(cd)`

## Interactive mode

Click on fields to expand or collapse JSON tree, use mouse wheel to scroll view.

Next commands available in interactive mode:

|             Key               |         Command                              |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `q` or `Esc` or `Ctrl`+`c`    | Exit                                         |
| `up` or `k`                   | Move cursor up                               |
| `down` or `j`                 | Move cursor down                             |
| `left` or `h`                 | Collapse                                     |
| `right` or `l`                | Expand                                       |
| `Shift`+`right` or `L`        | Expand all under cursor                      | 
| `e`                           | Expand all                                   |
| `E`                           | Collapse all                                 |
| `g`                           | Scroll to top                                |
| `G`                           | Scroll to bottom                             |
| `.`                           | Edit filter                                  |
| `/`                           | Search                                       |
| `n`                           | Find next                                    |
| `p`                           | Exit and print JSON to stdout                |
| `P`                           | Exit and print fully expanded JSON to stdout |
| `x` or `Ctrl`+`e`             | Exit and print selected sub-JSON to stdout   |

These commands are available when editing the filter:

|             Key               |         Command         |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `Enter`                       | Apply filter            |
| `Ctrl`+`u`                    | Clear filter            |
| `Ctrl`+`w`                    | Delete last part        |
| `up`/`down`                   | Select autocomplete     |

### Searching

Press `/` and type regexp pattern to search in current JSON. Search work with currently applied filter.

Examples of pattern and corresponding regexp: 

|   Pattern  |    RegExp   |
|------------|-------------|
| `/apple`   | `/apple/ig` |
| `/apple/`  | `/apple/`   |
| `/apple/u` | `/apple/u`  |
| `/\w+`     | `/\w+/ig`   | 

### Selecting text

You may found what you can't just select text in fx. This is due the fact that all mouse events redirected to stdin. To be able select again you need instruct your terminal not to do it. This can be done by holding special keys while selecting: 

|       Key        |   Terminal    |
|------------------|---------------|
| `Option`+`Mouse` | iTerm2, Hyper |
| `Fn`+`Mouse`     | Terminal.app  |
| `Shift`+`Mouse`  | Linux         |

> Note what you can press `p`/`P` to print everything to stdout and select if there.

## Memory Usage

You may find that sometimes, on really big JSON files, fx prints an error message like this:

```
FATAL ERROR: JavaScript heap out of memory 
```

V8 limits memory usage to around 2 GB by default. You can increase the limit by putting this line in your _.profile_:

```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=8192'
```
