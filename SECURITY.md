# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of fx seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to:

**anton@medv.io**

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Response Timeline

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours and will send you regular updates about our progress. If you have not received a response within 48 hours, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow the principle of coordinated disclosure. We ask that you:

- Give us reasonable time to investigate and fix the issue before making it public
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services
- Do not exploit a security issue you discover for any reason (this includes demonstrating additional risk)

Once we have fixed the issue, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability (and credit you, if you wish).

## Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Do not exploit a security issue you discover for any reason

We will not pursue legal action against security researchers who follow these guidelines.

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities in the latest version. We recommend always using the most recent version of fx.

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved, please submit a pull request or open an issue.
